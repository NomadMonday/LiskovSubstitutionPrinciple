## Summary
- I created this project as a demonstration of the Liskov Substitution Principle (the L in SOLID).
- It is a recreation of this demonstration by Tim Corey, except rewritten in Python: https://youtu.be/-3UXq2krhyw
- I wanted to create a semi-guided exercise where the objective is known, but the exact solution is not due to language differences. In this way, I could create a more challenging and engaging problem to solve, while also learning how to apply SOLID principles in Python.
- The Begin folder contains the starting point of the code before the principle is applied, and the End folder contains the refactored code after.
